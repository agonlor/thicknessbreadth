# Tools

This folder contains several tools for computing the thickness and breadth pairs.

- **Script** `script_tb_pairs.sh` is a script that does everything, from converting the mesh to a PGM file until creating the mesh files for the TB balls.
- **Binvox** [Binvox](https://www.patrickmin.com/binvox/) is a software developed by Patrick Min to voxelize surface meshes.
- **Viewbox** [Viewvox](https://www.patrickmin.com/viewvox/) is also a software by Patrick Min to voxelize to visualize the ".binvox" files generated by binvox.
- **Binvox2PGM** I made this simple software that translates a 3D discrete object in the "binvox" format into 3D PGM format. To compile it, do `g++ binvox2pgm.cpp -O3 -o binvox2pgm`.
- **TB-Diag** `tb-diag.py` is a Python script for generating the thickness-breadth diagram.
- **TB-Balls** `tb-balls.py` is a Python script for generating OBJ meshes for the thickness and breadth balls. I use it to render images with Blender.
- **Binvox2PGM** I made this simple software that translates a 3D discrete object in the "binvox" format into 3D PGM format. To compile it, do `g++ binvox2pgm.cpp -O3 -o binvox2pgm`.
- **PGM2Obj** This software generates a OBJ mesh from a PGM file. I made this tool with some code from a much larger project, so I only provide the executable.
